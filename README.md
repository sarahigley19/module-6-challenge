Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

##  Project Description
I actually had fun working on this project! I feel like things are getting easier and easier to understand and figure out. I still want more practice with javascript, but I think that this point I can read it farily well. It's writing it that i am still strugglings with.

My favorite part was the design, obvi. But I also liked adding the cute icons to the 5-day weather forcast. I also ran into an issue I couldn't figure out. Whenever I would try to make the 5-day forcast start on the next day, it would only show a four-day forcast. Still didn't figure that out!
